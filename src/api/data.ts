      Management is so different from engineering and requires such a wide
      set of skills- I find myself incredibly lucky to be able to grow my
      talents and abilities in such different areas. I truly enjoy helping
      my devs not only day to day but also in their career progression
      journey.`

      body: `In my dev time, I help design and implement beautiful, responsive,
      accessible UIs. My main focus is always on the end user and UX is
      always at the front of my mind. That being said, I'm also a stickler
      for modular, reusable code and think that having a set of coding
      practises within the team is invaluable. I'm a big fan of Agile
      development and enjoy participating in all of the various SCRUM
      ceremonies. In addition to this I'm well versed in planning,
      gathering requirements, and refining tickets. I work closely with my
      team and project manager to ensure that deliverables are met in a
      timely and efficient manner.`

      volunteer initiaties, mostly helping women and minorities learn to
      code.`

      body: `I went to 3 universities before finally getting my degree, but being
      an engineer means you're never not a "student". One thing I enjoy
      about engineering is the fact that things are constantly changing-
      what's the "best" today might not be the "best" tomorrow, and
      frameworks/languages are always being changed and created.`

      have now obtained "Indefinite Leave to Remain", meaning I'm able to
      reside in the UK permanently, which is a huge relief to my fiancee
      and two pups!`
